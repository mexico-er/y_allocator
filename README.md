# y_allocator

a `malloc` alternative.

## Questions
  - Is `yalloc` faster than `malloc`?
    - It is, but only when larger amounts of data, but there are less allocations in total, as seen in the benchmark program here: https://codeishot.com/4gbbTuJw.
  - Why is it named "yallocator"?
    - It has the word "y'all" in it.
